 Gas Station
## Project description
This project is about fuel stations and cars. These fuel stations establish fuel pricing and compute charges for refilling specified liter quantities. Meanwhile, automobiles are distinguished by seat capacity, fuel consumption rate (measured in liters per kilometer), and tank capacity. Each car retains data regarding its passenger count and the current fuel level. When cars refuel at a gas station, they consistently replenish their entire fuel tanks. The incurred expenses are distributed evenly among the car's occupants, who collectively cover the bill.
